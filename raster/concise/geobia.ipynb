Spatial resolution is the one-sided distance of a ground resolution cell, or pixel, measured using a linear unit (i.e., meters). High spatial resolution imagery has smaller pixels than coarse spatial resolution imagery. This section presents new ways to consider spatial resolution in the context of GEOBIA.\n","\n","The previous definitions of spatial resolution focus on inherent characteristics of the imagery itself, but pixel size also has an important relationship with the objects of interest on the ground. **H-resolution** and **L-resolution** refer to situations when image pixels are smaller or larger, respectively, than objects of interest on the ground. That is, an H-resolution image will have objects composed of multiple image pixels. An L-resolution image will have multiple objects per pixel. Most images will contain large and small objects so this conceptualization of spatial resolution varies across an image and between different types of images.\n","\n","### Pixel-based vs Object-based classifications\n","Two broad types of image classification algorithms exist: pixel-based and object-based. In **pixel-based** classifications, individual pixels are classified indepent of neighboring pixels--there is no concept of a neighborhood of pixels that comprise a single object. These algorithms often produce 'noisy' classifications where individual pixels may be classified differently than their surrounding neighbors because of within class reflectance variations. Moreover, these algorithms may be computational inefficient because they classify multiple neighboring pixels individually even though they are all part of a single object.\n","\n","**Object-based** classification algorithms are a response to the shortcomings of pixel-based classification algorithms that recognize spatial relationships between neighboring pixels. GEOBIA is the term used for object-based classification with Earth Observation imagery. GEOBIA is used to classify H-resolution imagery, but does not require high spatial resolution imagery. GEOBIA consists of the following three steps that are further explained and demonstrated in the next sections of the Jupyter notebook.\n","1. Segmentation\n","2.

Segmentation is usually run many times until good parameters are found. Good parameters will be different for different images and will depend on their spatial, spectral and radiometric resolutions. They will be different for different seasons and places on the Earth. It takes time to find a good set of segmentation parameters. Calculating spectral, shape and texture attributes may not be very iterative, but finding the best combination of them in the classification process can be. Which are the best predictors of your objects of interest? Classification, too, can be very iterative as you refine training data and classification algorithm parameters. Phew! There are lots of moving parts to GEOBIA. BUT, every classification algorithm, properly executed, takes time to get just right. GEOBIA can produce excellent results when you have H-resolution."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"KkT0s1HOOimF"},"source":["<div class=\"alert alert-danger\" role=\"alert\">\n","\n","### <a id='challenge'></a>Challenge\n","\n","[Back to top](#TOC_TOP)\n","\n","</div>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"lCAbOsdkOimF"},"source":["<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">\n","\n","#### Time to explore!\n","\n","You are encouraged to explore different segmentation algorithms available in the [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org) package.
